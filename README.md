# Skin Disease Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a **Skin Disease Detection** system that identifies skin infections from images using Machine Learning (ML). The system is integrated into a **React+Vite** web application and enables users to upload images for analysis. The ML model classifies at least **2-3 types of skin diseases**.

## Features
- **Trainable Model:** The model is trained on a dataset of skin infection images.
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images instead of using a webcam.
- **ML Integration:** The system processes images and detects skin infections.
- **React+Vite Frontend:** A modern web interface for users to interact with the model.
- **Pinecone Integration:** Used for storing medical data.



## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js & npm
- React with Vite
- Required Python libraries (`NumPy`, `TensorFlow/PyTorch`, `FastAPI/Flask`)


## Usage
1. Open the frontend in a browser.
2. Upload an image of a skin infection.
3. The ML model processes the image and returns the detected disease.
4. Results and analysis are displayed on the UI.

## Model Training
- The model is trained on labeled images of skin infections.
- Uses deep learning techniques for classification.
- Training script: `train.py`.

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset for better accuracy.
- Improve UI/UX for seamless interaction.
- Implement real-time analysis.
- Integrate more skin disease classifications.
